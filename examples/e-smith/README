This is an experimental version of the e-smith server and gateway email
retrieval configuration interface.  The goal is to see whether
FormMagick can be used by e-smith instead of their more traditional
CGIs.

The original perl script used by e-smith is in emailretrieval-orig.pl,
and its HTML output (showing the form layout) is in
emailretrieval-orig.html
