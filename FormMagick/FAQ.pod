FormMagick FAQ - Frequently asked questions about FormMagick


=head1 HOW DO I...

=head2 How do I check that my XML is valid?

=head2 How do I customise the look and feel of my forms?

Use cascading style sheets.  Take a look at the HTML source output by
FormMagick, and you'll see that most things have a "label" attribute to
make CSS easier. 

=head2 How do I make my own validation routines?

Simply create a routine in your CGI script which accepts the data to
validate as an argument.  Have it return "OK" on success or a detailed
error message on failure.

    sub my_validation {
        my $data = shift;
        if ($data =~ /$some_pattern/) {
            return "OK";
        } else {
            return "That looks wrong to me.";
        }
    }

=head2 How do I add translations into another language?

Use the add_lexicon() method:

    $f->add_lexicon("fr", { "Yes" => "Oui", "No" => "Non" });

=head2 How do I do extra processing when a user clicks "Next"?

Use a POST-EVENT on the PAGE element.  Create a subroutine that does
what you want:

    sub process_credit_card {
        my $cgi = shift;
	my $cardnum = $cgi->param("cardnum");
	my $response = do_processing($cardnum);
	print "<p>$response</p>";
    }

=head2 How do I choose which page to go to based on user input?

Use a PAGE POST-EVENT and set the value of the "wherenext" CGI
parameter:

    sub my_post_page_event {
        my $cgi = shift;
	if ($cgi->param("foo") eq "bar") {
            $cgi->param(-name => "wherenext", -value => "GoToThisPageName")
        } elsif ($cgi->param("had_enough") eq "Yes") {
            $cgi->param(-name => "wherenext", -value => "Finish")
        }
    }

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

=head2 General troubleshooting tips

Try turning on debugging when you invoke FormMagick:
    
    my $f = new FormMagick( DEBUG => 1 );

=head2 Why isn't my data preserved from one page to the next?

You probably need to make your C<session-tokens> directory writable and
executable by the web server.  Either:

    chown www session-tokens 
       (assuming your webserver runs as the www user)
    chmod 700 session-tokens

Or...

    chown 777 session-tokens
